1 - Click in "Browse"

2 - Load the csv file containing the Historical data.

**Important**

The layout of this document must be:

1st column - SKU code

2nd column - Demand

3rd column - Period in a text format "YYYY-MM".

3 - After loaded, you may see a table with the loaded data

4 - In the field "SKU" inform the desired sku.

5 - In the tab "Model" you will see the chosen model, the estimation
including the range representing 95% of confidence interval and a plot
with historical and estimated data

5.1 - In this first example (an item with seasonal and trend pattern)
the model chosen was an seasonal pattern with lag 12 [12] seasonal
autoregressive order (1) and seasonal difference order I(1). In essence,
the model SARIMA (0,0,0)(1,1,0)[12]

5.2 - In this second example, a simulated demand of an item with only a
positive trend pattern. The chosen model was a single AR(2) with 1
differentiation I(1)

5.3 - For items without any pattern, only a moving average was enough.
In this example the model chosen was an ARIMA(0,0,2).

6 - In the tab "Residuals" you will see the residual analysis. In the
three examples (item "A" without any pattern, "B" with trend and "C"
with trend and season pattern) the residuals are independent and
identically distributed. The ACF graph shows that all residuals are not
statistically significant, normally distributed (KS test) and are
homoskedastic (ARCH test).
